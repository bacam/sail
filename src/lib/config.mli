(** Sail model configuration using JSON. *)

open Type_check

(** Rewrite any any configuration nodes in the AST, and gather
    configuration information.

    This rewrite performs two operations:

    First, It takes a JSON configuration file as input and replaces
    E_config nodes within the AST using information within that JSON.
    For example:

    {@sail[
    config a.b.c : T
    ]}

    will cause [a.b.c] to be looked up in the provided JSON and
    whatever JSON value is at that key will be interpreted as the type
    [T] and inserted in the AST.

    If [a.b.c] does not exist, then the E_config node will remain to
    be instantiated by a configuration value at runtime.

    Second, for each type [T] attached to a configuration node (which
    may have been inferred from context by the type system), we will
    also attempt to synthesise a JSON Schema. If [T] cannot be turned
    into a valid schema then this function raises a fatal type error
    exception. This schema cannot capture every possible invariant of
    an ISA configuration, but it does provide enough to guarantee that
    a configuration applied at runtime will not break type-safety
    assuming it validates against the schema.

    The function will return that JSON schema alongside the re-written
    AST. *)
